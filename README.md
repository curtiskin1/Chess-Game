Any assumptions

Additional features that you implemented (if applicable)
--> I used the StringBuilder class to create a string representation of the board including the indexes of each row and column
--> Created a helper method (checkWinner()) to scan the board after the game is over to determine which player has won

--> One thing that may cause bugs or failures in the program is when user do not follow the format to enter move
